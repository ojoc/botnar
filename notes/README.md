## An Example

<blockquote>Noncommunicable diseases alone will cost low- and middle-income countries more than $7 trillion in the next 15 years.  <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ENGLISH_Why_it_Matters_Goal_3_Health.pdf/">(Sustainable Development Goals 3: Good Health & Well-Being Why it Matters)</a></blockquote>

<br>

A focus of the [blog](https://www.fondationbotnar.org/investing-in-young-peoples-wellbeing-and-future/) that accompanies the Fondation Botnar [Fit for the Future](https://www.fondationbotnar.org/fit-for-the-future-call/) call is non-communicable diseases.  Non-communicable diseases & mental disorders is a focus of United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals:

  <blockquote><b><a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/health/">Sustainable Development Goals 3</a>, Health & Well-Being, Target 4</b>: By 2030, reduce by one third premature mortality from non-communicable diseases through prevention and treatment and promote mental health and well-being.</blockquote>

<br>

Hence, in this example, a **thematic/geographic** context might be **Health & Well-Being/Ghana**.   And a **challenge** option is **Non-communicable Diseases & Mental Health**.  There are four aspects of non-communicable diseases (NCD) and certain mental disorders that are worth noting

* Their main risk factors, or causes, are modifiable behaviours, hence prevention is key.  ([WHO, 2016](https://github.com/ojoc/botnar/blob/master/references/WHO%202016%20Global%20Action%20Plan%20for%20the%20Prevention%20%26%20Control%20of%20NCD.pdf))

* Behavioural risk factors develop over time, from quite a young age, hence it is important to start early “Opportunities to prevent and control noncommunicable diseases occur at multiple stages of life; interventions in early life often offer the best chance for primary prevention” ([WHO, 2016](https://github.com/ojoc/botnar/blob/master/references/WHO%202016%20Global%20Action%20Plan%20for%20the%20Prevention%20%26%20Control%20of%20NCD.pdf))

* Prevention is critical to “the success of at least nine [Sustainable Development Goals]” ([Nugent, 2018](https://github.com/ojoc/botnar/blob/master/references/Lancet%20NCD%20Task%20Force%202018%20Investing%20in%20NCD%20Prevention.pdf)).  These include Gender & Inequality, Sustainable Development Goals 5 & 10 respectively.

* Prevention is cost effective ([WHO, 2018](https://github.com/ojoc/botnar/blob/master/references/WHO%202018%20Saving%20Lives%20Spending%20Less.pdf), [Betram, 2018](https://github.com/ojoc/botnar/blob/master/references/Lancet%20NCD%20Task%20Force%202018%20NCD%20Investment%20%26%20ROI.pdf)); releasing funds for more SDG investments.

[Nugent](https://github.com/ojoc/botnar/blob/develop/references/Lancet%20NCD%20Task%20Force%202018%20Investing%20in%20NCD%20Prevention.pdf) briefly noted the particular burden of non-communicable diseases and mental health on women – a vicious cycle of health and financial risks - and hence the impact on gender equality.  Studying the [Lancet's non-communicable diseases task force papers](https://info.thelancet.com/infocus-ncds), the WHO's [non-communicable diseases and women pages](https://www.who.int/global-coordination-mechanism/ncd-themes/NCD-and-women/en/),  and the pages of [The Taskforce on Women and Non-communicable Diseases](https://www.womenandncds.org/), it becomes clear that tackling non-communicable diseases & mental health is critical to Sustainable Development Goals 5: Gender Equality.

#### Points of Interest & Ghana

* The [non-communicable diseases country profiles](https://github.com/ojoc/botnar/blob/develop/references/WHO%202018%20Noncommunicable%20Diseases%20Country%20Profiles.pdf) document highlights the effect of noncommunicable diseases in Ghana.
* The [youth index](https://github.com/ojoc/botnar/blob/develop/references/IYF%202017%20Global%20Youth%20Well-Being%20Index.pdf) document notes that volunteering amongst youth is approximately 25% in Ghana.
* [Somanje's](https://github.com/ojoc/botnar/blob/develop/references/Somanje%202020%20Challenges%20and%20Potential%20Solutions%20for%20Sustainable%20Urban-Rural%20Linkages.pdf) paper highlights the importance of addressing gender inclusiveness w.r.t. urban-rural linkage.
* AstraZeneca's [Youth Health Programmes](https://www.younghealthprogrammeyhp.com/programmes.html) illustrate a few implemented youth noncommunicable diseases & mental health programmes, amongst other programmes.
