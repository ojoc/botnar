## Notes

A focus of the [blog](https://www.fondationbotnar.org/investing-in-young-peoples-wellbeing-and-future/) that accompanies the Fondation Botnar [Fit for the Future](https://www.fondationbotnar.org/fit-for-the-future-call/) call is non-communicable diseases.  Non-communicable diseases & mental disorders is the focus of **Target 4** of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 3:

<blockquote>
[Sustainable Development Goals 3](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/health/)
Health & Well-Being
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Target 4
By 2030, reduce by one third premature mortality from non-communicable diseases through prevention and treatment and promote mental health and well-being.
</blockquote>

Hence, a **thematic/geographic** context might be **Health & Well-Being/Ghana**.   And a **challenge** option is **Non-communicable Diseases & Mental Health**.

There are four aspects of non-communicable diseases (NCD) and certain mental disorders that are worth noting   

* Their main risk factors, or causes, are modifiable behaviours, hence prevention is key.  ([WHO, 2016](https://github.com/ojoc/botnar/blob/master/references/WHO%202016%20Global%20Action%20Plan%20for%20the%20Prevention%20%26%20Control%20of%20NCD.pdf))
* Risky behaviours develop over time, from quite a young age, hence it is important to start early “Opportunities to prevent and control noncommunicable diseases occur at multiple stages of life; interventions in early life often offer the best chance for primary prevention” ([WHO, 2016](https://github.com/ojoc/botnar/blob/master/references/WHO%202016%20Global%20Action%20Plan%20for%20the%20Prevention%20%26%20Control%20of%20NCD.pdf))
* Prevention is critical to “the success of at least nine [Sustainable Development Goals]” ([Nugent, 2018](https://github.com/ojoc/botnar/blob/master/references/Lancet%20NCD%20Task%20Force%202018%20Investing%20in%20NCD%20Prevention.pdf)).  These include Gender & Inequality, Sustainable Development Goals 5 & 10 respectively.
* Prevention is cost effective ([WHO, 2018](https://github.com/ojoc/botnar/blob/master/references/WHO%202018%20Saving%20Lives%20Spending%20Less.pdf), [Betram, 2018](https://github.com/ojoc/botnar/blob/master/references/Lancet%20NCD%20Task%20Force%202018%20NCD%20Investment%20%26%20ROI.pdf)); releasing funds for more SDG investments.

Nugent briefly noted the particular burden of non-communicable diseases and mental health on women – a vicious cycle of health and financial risks - and hence the impact on gender equality.  Studying the Lancet's non-communicable diseases task force papers, the WHO's [non-communicable diseases and women pages](https://www.who.int/global-coordination-mechanism/ncd-themes/NCD-and-women/en/),  and the pages of [The Taskforce on Women and Non-communicable Diseases](https://www.womenandncds.org/), it becomes clear that tackling non-communicable diseases & mental health is critical to Sustainable Development Goals 5: Gender Equality.


#### Causes
* Alchohol
* Tobacco
* Unhealthy Diet
* Physical Inactivity
* Indoor & Outdoor Air Pollution


#### Link to Global Challenges
As outlined above, this example is linked to Sustainable Development Goals 3, Target 4

#### Approach
Prevention Content + Reinforcement Learning of Content via Games + Activity Clubs


### Addendum

* The country profiles highlights the effect of noncommunicable diseases in Ghana.

* The youth index document notes that civic participation amongst youth is approximately 25% in Ghana.

* Somanje's paper highlights the importance of addressing gender inclusiveness w.r.t. urban-rural linkage.

* AstraZeneca's [Youth Health Programmes](https://www.younghealthprogrammeyhp.com/programmes.html) illustrate a few implemented youth noncommunicable diseases & mental health programmes.
